// Package unavail is a library to help with the determination of if a time exists
// within a certain cron expression. Employee unavailabiliy is represented as cron
// expression, and as such it is helpful when evaluating whether an employee can
// work a certain shift to be able to insert a time range, duration step, and
// the expressions and return a boolean on whether the employee is not available
// during that time
package unavail

// api should look like unavail.able() bool
