- track things by employee rather than actual date
- for each employee have a dict which has every day they were scheduled
- for each day we want to plot we can then render the week's calendar by employee
- need to create a weighting system so that certain traits about an employee
- store generated dates
- employees should have preferred roles
- employees can have a limited amount of positions
- need team leader feature that must be assigned every day

* should display employee metrics
* needs alertings rules like employees shouldn't have back to back shifts and etc
  - This can be presented as generation options
* Eventually we should also make it so that it's easy to place new employees in shifts via the return schedule
  so commit schedule could actully just take an updated schedule
